# No longer maintained.

Welcome to the new re-written Deno Sass module, with complete feature set
(import, variables, functions, mixins, and even CLI !)

I spent 24h updating the module to make it work, it now has a new name
(previously Degrass) which I think sounds better.

Please note that even tho I believe i have tested every test case for this, i
don't know how good it can handle things..

I know that there are some errors that might now be shown at compile time, but
no crash so far.

## > ‚ö†Ô∏è This module will soon be re-writen with a new external library called Rsass, it will also be using FFI for the Deno port and a smaller version in WebAssembly for browsers.

## Command line

```bash
# Install via 
deno install --allow-env --allow-write --allow-read --allow-net --unstable -n denosass https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hironichu/denosass/main/cli.ts
# Basic example

# This will take every file in the dir (non recursively) and compile then while keeping their name and adding .min.css, into the ./out folder.
denosass compile -f compressed -o ./out ./scssdir

# This will compile only the main.scss file and output the content to ./out/main.min.css 
denosass compile -f compressed -o ./out ./scssdir/main.scss

# Denosass accepts multiple output, and will if set, combine them together, or just compile them as normal.
denosass compile -f compressed -o ./out ./scssdir ./anotherfolder ./afile.scss

# The above example will look for the first file in 
# ./scssdir and ./anotherfolder , 
# compile them while including the @imports and so on,
# and will also compile the ./afile.scss to its own 
# (if this file includes modules within the other folder, Denosass will include them.)

#Last but not least, if you don't set -o (output dir) denosass will write content to the STDOUT. (using Deno.stdout.writeSync())
denosass compile -f compressed ./some/folder ./or/some/file.scss

#CLI Support also STDIN, if you set no argument you can use the Standard input to compile Sass.
denosass compile
üîµ[DenoSass] Write your sass code to stdin and press CTRL-D to compile
body {
color:red;
}
body{color:red}%
```

Please note that if the output folder doesn't exist, Denosass will create it, if
it exists, Denosass will empty it's content before creating new files.

> Every CSS file created are read only file (644)

## The API

I have been working really hard to make a very user friendly API only one
function is necessary to instanciate the Sass Class, you can however import it
and use it how you want.

## Here is a basic rundown on how the API works.

### Compiling Text

Basic example, this will only compile the text within the brackets. To export
the result you need to call one of these functions :

- .to_string(format: "expanded" | "compressed")
- .to_buffer(format: ...)
- .to_file( { destDir, destFile, format } )

```ts
import sass from "https://deno.land/x/denosass/mod.ts";

const compiler = sass(`
  body {
    background: orange;
    >.container {
      color: black;
      display:flex;
      &.some {
        content: "Some text content";
      }
    }
  }
`);
```

sass take an optional object as an argument, which contains the ability to set
the format for the next function call (.to_string..) here is an example :

```ts
const from_files = sass(`...`, {
  //The load_paths will allow you to import files that are somewhere else in your system, note that this feature is still unstable !
  load_paths: ["some/relative/path", "/or/absolute/include/path"],
  quiet: true, // Optional, Define if you want to see Sass warning or not.
  style: "compressed", //Optional, by default "compressed" is selected.
});
```

Once you're done, call one of the function, if you don't set a format, the
default one will be "compressed"

```ts
const css = compiler.to_string();
console.log(css);
```

You can also export to a buffer, note that you can call .to_string(),
to_buffer() and to_file() as much as you want. All data will be read by the
WebAssembly VM at compile time, Deno checks if everything is right to compile.

Here you can export to a folder the content you compiled : same as before,
format is not mandatory if you set destFile , Deno will output content in this
file, if you don't, a untitled.min.css file will be created

```ts
compiler.to_file({
  destDir: "./out",
});
```

---

### Compiling Files / Folders / Buffer

Denosass takes both arrays of string, strings and buffers, as shown here :

```ts
// Here we have one folder and a file.
const compile = sass(["path/to/some/folder", "path/to/file.scss"]);
```

By default it will look for every .scss and .sass file in the subfolders, too. You can limit the depth of the search by setting the walkMaxDepth option.

```ts
// Here we are limiting the depth to 2, so it will only look for files in the folder and its direct subfolders
const compile = sass(["path/to/some/folder"], {
  walkMaxDepth: 2,
});
```

```ts

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è PSA, Denosass perform no Content type check for the file / folder you use, it's entirely up to you. it will look for .scss and .sass file only, ‚ö†Ô∏è

Here is an example on how you can use a buffer

```ts
//This is not really useful, only if you want to catch a buffer from a request without transforming it to a string.
const compile = sass(Deno.readFileSync("somefile.scss"));
```

### Features subject to changes

For now, if you set a filename during the export to File, (both in CLI and in
the API), Denosass will append every file you have imported into a single one
with that name, this is useful if you want to build a static app with one single
CSS file, but it might now be convenient.

That's why setting a name isn't required by default.

```ts
const compiler = compile('some/folder');
compiler.to_file({
  destDir: "./dist",
  destFile: "mysupercss" //the extension is set depending on the format.
  format: "compressed"
}) //Returns a boolean.
```

## Browser API

As of today, some feature are not available in browsers, (such as files/folder),
I need to edit some stuff so the Deno namespace doesn't stop the code from
running in modern browsers, but it should work as the older one did. g

## Deploy

This module should work today, with the entire featureset on Deploy

## Core API

By default, i made a wrapper around the function exported form the Wasm code,
this is because I want to have some nice feature around (such as multiple file
support, export to file/buffer etc...)

however you can directly use these functions if you don't need the additional
features.

```ts
import { file, str } from "./wasm/grass.deno.js";

//From a string, note that it will resolve any imported module from import.meta.url (the current dir of the typescript file being executed.)
const fromstr = str(
  `
  @import 'superlib';
`,
  {
    load_paths: [
      "./libscss",
      "/Users/ekko/Documents/testscss",
    ],
    style: "expanded",
    quiet: true,
  },
);
console.log(fromstr);

//And from a file
const fromfile = file(`./myscss/myscss.scss`, {
  load_paths: [
    "./libscss",
    "/Users/ekko/Documents/testscss",
  ],
  style: "expanded",
  quiet: true,
});
console.log(fromfile);
///
```

And that's about it, thank you for reading, I have been spending now 25 hours
writing all of this module from the ground up !

Feel free to share and support my work using Sponsors, I'd really appreciate it.
